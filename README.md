Minetest Lua API Python Parser
Written by Lars MÃ¼ller alias LMD or appgurueu, mainly for educational purposes; I needed to train my rusty python again :P
Only works with reduced Markdown set, as required for lua_api.txt.
Uses Bootstrap 4 and JQuery to generate a beautiful HTML Website from lua_api.txt, table of content inclusive !
Just for fun, a background Minetest Scene is generated each time, too !
I think this may be useful, as currently, the only way to navigate through lua_api.txt is a full-text search in the browser.

"The images" are in the following all images except "background.png", which is generated.
